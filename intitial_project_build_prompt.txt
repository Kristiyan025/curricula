You are a senior software architect and lead engineer.

Read requirements.md carefully, which is generated via initial_prompt.txt.
Generate the full project implementation that satisfies ALL requirements.

Rules:
- Create all necessary files and folders
- Use production-ready code
- Follow the architecture implied by the requirements
- If something is underspecified, make a reasonable assumption and document it in README.md
- Do NOT stop after scaffolding; implement fully
- Work incrementally and keep going until the project is complete

Start by analyzing requirements.md & initial_prompt.txt, then begin creating files.
